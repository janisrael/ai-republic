What is Overfitting?
Memorization vs. Generalization: Overfitting occurs when an AI model "memorizes" the training data, including its noise and specific quirks, rather than learning the underlying general patterns. 
Performance Gap: This leads to excellent performance on the training data but significantly worse performance when the model encounters new, unseen data. 
Analogy: It's like a student who memorizes specific answers for a practice test but can't solve new problems on the actual exam because they didn't understand the concepts. 
Why Does it Happen?
Model Complexity: The model is too complex (e.g., a deep neural network with too many layers) for the amount and diversity of the training data. 
Insufficient Data: The training dataset is too small, lacks diversity, or contains too much noisy, irrelevant information. 
Over-training: The model is trained for too long on the same dataset. 


Cross-Validation: Split data into multiple folds, train the model on some folds, and test on the held-out fold to assess generalization ability. 
Regularization: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the model's complexity, discouraging it from fitting noise. 
Simplify Model Architecture: Reduce the number of layers or parameters in complex models like neural networks. 
More Data: Increase the size and diversity of the training data to provide more examples for the model to learn from. 
Early Stopping: Monitor validation performance and stop training when it starts to degrade, even if training loss is still improving.
