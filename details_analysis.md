üí° Key Insights
Ollama gives us basic architecture info - enough for comparison
Our training system tracks training details - job status, progress, datasets
We can add evaluation metrics - accuracy, speed, memory
We can't get deep PyTorch/TensorFlow details - Ollama abstracts this
We can create comprehensive comparisons - using what we have
The question is: What specific details do you want to focus on first?
Model architecture comparison?
Training performance tracking?
Evaluation metrics visualization?
All of the above?
